### What's new on Goteo V3:

This is a list of (still most work-in-progress) of the new features:

- A full rewrite of the view subsystem using a template system (using Foil).
- Optimizations, bug fixes
- A development cycle based on github. Meaning that we will publish bug fixes and improvements regularly in github.

- Using grunt for developing
- Better translations
